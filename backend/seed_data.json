Check all tack room doors are locked (Thunderbolt the Cob has learned to open them)\n3. Ensure all horses have water (Mr Snuffles tips his over for fun)\n4. Close and bolt all stable doors (twice for Sir Kicks-A-Lot)\n5. Check the feed room - if Barry Muckspreader left treats out, hide them\n6. Turn off water heaters (unless you want another Great Flood of 2019)\n7. Lock the main gate and pray the peacocks don't escape again\n\nEMERGENCY CONTACTS\n\nYard Manager (Baroness Canter-Downhill): 07700 900100\n'Definitely Not Dodgy' Dave the Farrier: 07700 800999\nValley Vets (ask for Dr. Hoofington): 07700 800001\nPanic Stations (Fire/Police/Ambulance): 999\n\nFIRE PROCEDURE\n\n1. Raise the alarm - shout 'FIRE!' (not 'FREE CARROTS!' - we tried that)\n2. Call 999 - address is Nags Rest Manor, Muck Heap Lane\n3. Release horses from stables if safe (alphabetically - they get jealous)\n4. Move horses to Far Paddock (the one WITHOUT the aggressive geese)\n5. Do NOT attempt to fight fire yourself (remember Timothy and the hose incident)\n6. Meet emergency services at main gate\n7. Account for all horses, staff, and the yard cat (Lord Whiskers)\n\nNOTE: If the fire is in the hay barn, we saw nothing. Insurance purposes.",

      "content": "GENERAL WORKPLACE RISK ASSESSMENT\nNags Rest Manor Equestrian Centre\n\nPURPOSE\nThis assessment exists because apparently some of you need reminding that gravity is constant and buckets exist at knee height.\n\nHAZARD 1: SLIPPERY SURFACES\nRisk: The yard is occasionally wet. This is Horsfordshire. If you weren't expecting rain, we have concerns.\n- Mitigation: Wear appropriate footwear. 'Appropriate' does not include wellies with holes, trainers, or those flip-flops Janet wore that one time.\n- In wet conditions: Walk like a penguin. Dignified waddling is preferable to spectacular sliding.\n\nHAZARD 2: TRIP HAZARDS\nRisk: Buckets, brooms, wheelbarrows, and that rope Thunderbolt keeps untying will conspire against you.\n- Mitigation: Keep walkways clear. If you put something down, remember where.\n- Special note: The yard cat, Lord Whiskers, counts as a mobile trip hazard. He appears underfoot with malicious intent.\n\nHAZARD 3: MANUAL HANDLING\nRisk: Hay bales and feed sacks are heavier than they look. Your back is not a forklift.\n- Mitigation: Bend your knees, not your enthusiasm. Ask for help with heavy items.\n- Exception: The wheelbarrow full of shavings that Barry insists on overloading every single time despite being told NOT TO.\n\nHAZARD 4: WORKING AT HEIGHT\nRisk: Ladders exist. So does gravity. They have a complicated relationship.\n- Mitigation: Three points of contact. Always. The hay loft does not count as 'ground level just higher up.'\n\nEMERGENCY PROCEDURES\nIn case of injury: First aid kit is in the tack room (green box, not the red one - that's Thunderbolt's special supplements).\nEmergency contact: Call the Baroness. She'll sigh heavily but she'll come.\n\nSigned: Barnaby Hoofington-Smythe\nDate: See next review date\nReview: Annual, or after any incident involving Timothy and a ladder",

      "content": "HORSE HANDLING RISK ASSESSMENT\nNags Rest Manor Equestrian Centre\n\nFUNDAMENTAL TRUTH\nHorses weigh approximately 500kg. You weigh considerably less. Physics will not negotiate.\n\nHAZARD 1: THE BACK END\nRisk: Horses kick. This is not a personality flaw; it's a survival instinct you're about to discover firsthand.\n- Mitigation: Never approach from directly behind. Talk as you approach. Even Sir Kicks-A-Lot appreciates a heads-up.\n- Special warning: If a horse pins its ears, you have approximately 0.3 seconds to reconsider your life choices.\n\nHAZARD 2: THE FRONT END\nRisk: Teeth. They have them. They use them. Sometimes on you.\n- Mitigation: Keep fingers away from searching lips. The 'are there mints in there?' investigation is thorough.\n- Note: Thunderbolt has form for this. His innocent expression lies.\n\nHAZARD 3: LEADING HORSES\nRisk: A spooked horse doesn't stop to check if you're keeping up.\n- Mitigation: Stay at the shoulder. Never wrap lead rope around your hand. Your fingers have sentimental value.\n- Weather advisory: Wind + plastic bag + horse = unpredictable physics experiment\n\nHAZARD 4: HANDLING ON THE GROUND\nRisk: Feet. Theirs are iron-shod. Yours are not.\n- Mitigation: Steel-toe boots. No exceptions. Not even for 'just popping to check on Princess.'\n- Reality check: 'He never treads on me' is what everyone says until he does.\n\nSPECIFIC HORSE WARNINGS\n- Sir Kicks-A-Lot: The name is a warning label, not a quirky nickname.\n- Princess Floofypants: Will lean. All 600kg of her. Without warning.\n- Thunderbolt: Unpredictable. Assume he's planning something.\n- Mr Snuffles: Harmless until food is involved, then savage.\n\nREMEMBER\nNo task is so urgent that it can't be done safely. The horses will still be here tomorrow. Make sure you are too.\n\nSigned: The Baroness (who has the scars to prove she learned the hard way)",

The hay barn is not a drying room for socks.\n4. Report any suspicious smells immediately. Unless it's just the muck heap. We know about the muck heap.\n\nFIRE DISCOVERY PROCEDURE\n1. Raise the alarm. Shout 'FIRE!' clearly and loudly.\n   - DO NOT shout 'Free carrots!' We tried this as an evacuation drill once. Chaos ensued.\n2. Call 999 immediately. Address: Nags Rest Manor, 42 Muck Heap Lane, Little Trotting, HR5 3EQ.\n3. Do NOT attempt to fight the fire yourself.\n   - Especially DO NOT attempt creative use of the yard hose (Timothy, this means you).\n   - The extinguishers are for small fires only. If in doubt, get out.\n\nHORSE EVACUATION\n1. Release horses from stables if safe to do so.\n2. Lead to Far Paddock (NOT the one with the aggressive geese - that's Middle Paddock).\n3. If horses won't lead, consider opening stable doors and stepping back.\n4. DO NOT prioritise possessions over safety. Yes, the Spanish saddle is valuable. You are more valuable.\n\nASSEMBLY POINT\nBy the mounting block near the main gate. Account for all persons present.\n\nSPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS\n- Lord Whiskers (yard cat): He can look after himself. Has nine lives and uses them recklessly.\n- The peacocks: Accept that they will go wherever they want. This is fine.\n- Thunderbolt: Will either be the first out or the most dramatic. Prepare for both.\n\nFIRE EXTINGUISHER LOCATIONS\n- Tack room (red box, not the green one)\n- Feed room entrance\n- Main barn near the hay store (irony noted)\n- Office\n\nREMEMBER: Your safety first. Always. No exceptions.\n\nSigned: Barnaby Hoofington-Smythe, after extensive consultation with the fire service (who were very patient)",

      "content": "YARD ENVIRONMENT RISK ASSESSMENT\nNags Rest Manor Equestrian Centre\n\nGENERAL PRINCIPLE\nThe yard is an outdoor environment. It is subject to weather, wildlife, and the occasional escape attempt by Thunderbolt. Be prepared.\n\nWEATHER HAZARDS\n\nHeat:\n- Hydrate. Yes, you too, not just the horses.\n- Sun cream exists for a reason. Leather face is not a professional requirement.\n- Know the signs of heat stroke. In yourself and others.\n\nCold:\n- Layer up. Standing in the yard at 6am in January requires commitment and thermal underwear.\n- Frozen water troughs: Check and defrost. The horses cannot drink ice.\n- Black ice: It's invisible. Walk accordingly.\n\nWind:\n- Secure everything that can fly. Loose arena letters are missiles.\n- Horses + wind = spooking season. Handle with extra caution.\n- The plastic bag warning from the Horse Handling assessment applies double.\n\nRain:\n- Everything becomes a slip hazard. Refer to General Workplace assessment, Penguin Protocol.\n- Electrical storms: Do not shelter under trees. Do not hold metal implements.\n\nWILDLIFE CONCERNS\n\nThe Peacocks:\n- They live here. They scream at dawn. There is no solution.\n- Do not approach during breeding season. Maurice becomes... territorial.\n\nLord Whiskers (Yard Cat):\n- Appears underfoot with malicious timing.\n- Has claimed the best sunny spots. Do not disturb.\n\nThe Aggressive Geese (Middle Paddock):\n- There is no safe approach. Plan your route to avoid.\n- If pursued: Do not run (they take this as a challenge). Walk backwards maintaining eye contact.\n- The geese have won every confrontation to date. Accept this.\n\nWasps/Bees:\n- Inform management of any allergies. Epi-pens location: First aid kit, tack room.\n- Sugar attracts them. Mind your tea.\n\nRats:\n- Feed room procedures exist for a reason. Do not leave feed accessible.\n- If you see one, tell the Baroness. She has a plan. (The plan is called Kevin the Terrier.)\n\nSTRUCTURAL HAZARDS\n- Report any damage immediately. Broken rails, loose roof panels, holes appearing in places they shouldn't.\n- The hay loft steps are steep. Not a slide. Not a shortcut.\n\nSigned: The Yard Safety Committee (membership: everyone who learned something the hard way)",

      "content": "BIOSECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT\nNags Rest Manor Equestrian Centre\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\nOne sick horse can become many sick horses very quickly. Strangles, flu, herpes - equine diseases spread faster than gossip at a livery yard. Prevention is considerably cheaper than treatment.\n\nARRIVAL PROTOCOLS\n\nNew Horses:\n1. Isolation period: Minimum 21 days. No exceptions. No, not even for Princess Floofypants' new field companion.\n2. Health check on arrival by vet.\n3. Up-to-date vaccinations required before arrival.\n4. Negative strangles test recommended (required if yard is on alert).\n\nReturning Horses:\n- Shows/competitions: Monitor for 7 days. Report any symptoms.\n- Hospital discharge: Follow vet isolation instructions to the letter.\n\nVISITOR PROTOCOLS\n\nProfessionals (vets, farriers, physios):\n- Must report if they've been to a yard with known disease outbreak.\n- Disinfection of equipment between horses where practical.\n- Boot dips available at entrance. Use them.\n\nOther Visitors:\n- No visiting horses from other yards (the 'just popping over' rule is suspended indefinitely after the 2019 incident).\n- Hand washing after handling horses.\n\nDISEASE RECOGNITION\n\nCall the vet immediately if you notice:\n- Nasal discharge (not just the usual 'Thunderbolt sneezed' situation)\n- Coughing through the yard\n- Swollen glands\n- Fever (know how to take temperature - training available)\n- Loss of appetite (unusual in this group of professional hoovers)\n- Lethargy (actual lethargy, not just Mr Snuffles' general attitude)\n\nOUTBREAK PROCEDURES\n\nIf disease is suspected:\n1. Isolate affected horse immediately.\n2. Stop all horse movement in and out of yard.\n3. Contact all owners.\n4. Vet to confirm diagnosis.\n5. Follow vet isolation and treatment protocols.\n6. Deep clean and disinfect all equipment.\n\nDO NOT:\n- Panic (it helps nothing)\n- Share on Facebook before telling the Baroness (she will find out, and she will be cross)\n- Continue normal routines 'because it's probably nothing'\n\nROUTINE MEASURES\n- Fly control in summer (disease vectors)\n- Regular muck heap removal\n- Clean water troughs weekly\n- Separate equipment for isolation horses where possible\n\nSigned: Barnaby Hoofington-Smythe, with input from Valley Vets",

No. Just no. Call the vet.\n\nColic:\n- DO NOT give painkillers (affects vet diagnosis)\n- Remove food\n- Keep horse walking if they want to, standing if not\n- CALL VET IMMEDIATELY\n- Note times, symptoms, gut sounds\n\nLameness:\n- Assess severity. Non-weight bearing = vet now.\n- Check foot for obvious causes (stone, abscess)\n- Cold hose if swelling\n- DO NOT ride.

NOT flip-flops. NOT 'these old boots' with the toe worn through.\n  * We check. Seriously.\n\nRequired for specific tasks:\n\nRiding/lunging:\n- Approved riding hat (properly fitted, not from 1987)\n- Body protector recommended\n- Gloves for lunging (rope burns are not fun)\n\nMucking out:\n- Gloves recommended (blisters and manure are not friends)\n- Mask available if dust sensitive\n\nClipping:\n- Non-slip footwear (extra important with electric equipment)\n- Extension leads properly maintained\n\nHandling feed/supplements:\n- Gloves for chemicals\n- Mask for dusty supplements (especially Thunderbolt's special mix that creates mushroom clouds)\n\nMANUAL HANDLING\n\nThe Golden Rules:\n1. Your back is not a crane. It's not even a forklift. Stop treating it like one.\n2. If it's too heavy, get help. Asking is not weakness; it's intelligence.\n3. Bend your knees, not your spine.\n\nHay Bales:\n- Weight: Variable but assume heavy.\n- Technique: Hug close to body, lift with legs.\n- Do not: Throw from height, carry more than you can see over, compete with Barry (he will win, but his back will lose eventually).\n\nFeed Sacks:\n- Standard 20-25kg. That's heavy.\n- Use the sack truck. That's literally what it's for.\n- If lifting: Bend knees, straight back, hug bag, stand using legs.\n\nWater Buckets:\n- Full bucket = 10kg approximately.\n- Carry two half-full rather than one full.\n- Use the hosepipe where possible. Save your shoulders.\n\nWheelbarrows:\n- The Barry Technique: Overloading is not efficient. It's heavy, unstable, and impressive to no one.\n- Balanced loads are faster and safer.\n- Push, don't pull.\n\nShavings Bales:\n- Awkward shape, moderate weight.\n- Fork/hook them open, don't try to deadlift.\n- They're wrapped in plastic. Slippery. Plan accordingly.\n\nWARNING SIGNS SOMETHING IS TOO HEAVY:\n- You're holding your breath\n- Your face is changing colour\n- You're making 'effort noises'\n- You genuinely cannot see where you're going\n\nInjuries happen when we're rushing. Nothing is so urgent it can't wait for proper technique.\n\nSigned: The Baroness (who has seen every manual handling mistake possible and is tired)",
