Check all tack room doors are locked (Thunderbolt the Cob has learned to open them)\n3. Ensure all horses have water (Mr Snuffles tips his over for fun)\n4. Close and bolt all stable doors (twice for Sir Kicks-A-Lot)\n5. Check the feed room - if Barry Muckspreader left treats out, hide them\n6. Turn off water heaters (unless you want another Great Flood of 2019)\n7. Lock the main gate and pray the peacocks don't escape again\n\nEMERGENCY CONTACTS\n\nYard Manager (Baroness Canter-Downhill): 07700 900100\n'Definitely Not Dodgy' Dave the Farrier: 07700 800999\nValley Vets (ask for Dr. Hoofington): 07700 800001\nPanic Stations (Fire/Police/Ambulance): 999\n\nFIRE PROCEDURE\n\n1. Raise the alarm - shout 'FIRE!' (not 'FREE CARROTS!' - we tried that)\n2. Call 999 - address is Nags Rest Manor, Muck Heap Lane\n3. Release horses from stables if safe (alphabetically - they get jealous)\n4. Move horses to Far Paddock (the one WITHOUT the aggressive geese)\n5. Do NOT attempt to fight fire yourself (remember Timothy and the hose incident)\n6. Meet emergency services at main gate\n7. Account for all horses, staff, and the yard cat (Lord Whiskers)\n\nNOTE: If the fire is in the hay barn, we saw nothing. Insurance purposes.",
